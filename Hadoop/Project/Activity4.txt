2.Go to windows powershell and exec the cmd
docker exec -it bdeb81506085a00e5496a1d65d6e21d3fe711edb6007761d1025ff421d bash
3.stay in </# and not ~# in cmd prompt> and type "hive"
4.hive will begin
5.ctrl+l->kind of clear since clear cmd will not work in hive.
6.Check what databases and tables you have by following commands.
show databases;
show tables;
7.CREATE TABLE file(line STRING);
create new table named file and make a column named "line" of string datatype.
8.LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/root/file.txt' INTO TABLE file;
insert records from a file.txt which we have created in local linux container using vim command in activity 1
9.SELECT * from file;
10.DESCRIBE file;
this describes the datatype and column name of the table named file.
11.CREATE TABLE word_counts AS
    > SELECT word,COUNT(1) AS count FROM
    > (SELECT explode(split(line,' ')) AS word FROM file) w
    > GROUP BY word
    > ORDER BY count DESC;

The above steps are to create in hive.

#To create in files follow below things#
========================================

1.Create file01.txt (Hello World Bye World) using vim
vim file01.txt
2.vim wordCount.hive and enter belw lines
DROP TABLE files;
DROP TABLE word_counts;
CREATE TABLE files (line STRING);
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/file01.txt' INTO TABLE files;
CREATE TABLE word_counts AS
SELECT word, count(1) AS count FROM
(SELECT explode(split(line, ' ')) AS word FROM files) w
GROUP BY word
ORDER BY word;
3.execute using below cmd
hive -f wordCount.hive
